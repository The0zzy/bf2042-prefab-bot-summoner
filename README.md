## Description

### Capture Time

Whenever you enter a capture point, the time it takes to capture it will be shown in the onscreen messages.
If you leave a capture point, the debug messages and the capture point status will be reset.
By pressing "interact" you can teleport directly onto the next capture point of the map.

To check the behavior with more than one player, there is the possibility to summon bots around you.

### Bot summoning

You can summon multiple bots around you. **Crouch + Interact** will summon a new bot around you. 
The summoned bots will appear in four directions around you. They will rotate their position around you in order to not die.

To release all summoned bots go **prone + interact**. The bots will be killed and get kept around the spawn again.
